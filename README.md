# Mulsemedia
Mulsemedia, short for multimedia and multisensory media, refers to a concept that integrates multiple media modalities such as text, images, videos, audio, and interactive elements to create a rich and immersive user experience. This approach aims to engage users through various sensory channels, including visual, auditory, tactile, and sometimes even olfactory and gustatory stimuli. Mulsemedia is commonly used in fields like entertainment, education, advertising, and virtual reality applications to create compelling and interactive content that caters to diverse user preferences and enhances overall user engagement and understanding.

We have designed a portal called Technology Enhanced Mulsemedia Learning for STEM Education with olfactory, verbatim, and haptic senses to provide immersive learning experiences.
